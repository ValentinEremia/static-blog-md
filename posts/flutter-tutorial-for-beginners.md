#### This will be a small video/series on Flutter.

How it works, what it is, and how to get up and running using it.

#### In this video we cover:
* Installing Flutter
* Setting up dependencies for it to run
* Setting up VScode for Flutter
* Setting up Android Studio for Flutter
* Creating a Flutter App
* Running and testing Hot Reloading.

This is a quick guide but I hope you guys like it. If you are interested in more, follow me on twitter and youtube and I'll create more content around this.
